Description: This package encapsulates several graph thresholding utilities and analysis tools. 
  Thresholding a graph helps remove lesser important edges from a graph, and potentially 
  shrinking the graph by pruning off disconnected vertices. The analysis tools take in a graph input file, 
  and the user specifies what operations to perform on the graph to help determine the optimal threshold 
  for the graph. These thresholding tools rely on the igraph C library for graph creation and manipulation. 
  Other functionalities are used from the alglib mathematical library as well.
